Javascript fetch method, along with how to retrieve data from it with .then (how to deal
with objects of type Promise):
https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-fetch-api/

NOTE: from trial/error, it seems like no lines will occur in the same method after .then().
So when I did 
fetch(...).then( (response) => (response.json() ).then( (json) => {this.data = json.data} );
console.log("Hello");
The console.log did not occur
